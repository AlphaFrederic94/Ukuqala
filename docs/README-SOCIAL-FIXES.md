## 1. Firebase Indexes

The app is showing errors related to missing Firebase indexes. To fix these issues:

### Option 1: Using the Firebase Console (Recommended)

1. Click on the following links to create the required indexes:

   - For saved_posts collection:
     [Create saved_posts index](https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/careaiproto/firestore/indexes?create_composite=Ck9wcm9qZWN0cy9jYXJlYWlwcm90by9kYXRhYmFzZXMvKGRlZmF1bHQpL2NvbGxlY3Rpb25Hcm91cHMvc2F2ZWRfcG9zdHMvaW5kZXhlcy9fEAEaCkoGdXNlcklkEAEaDQoJY3JlYXRlZEF0EAIaDAoIX19uYW1lX18QAg)

   - For notifications collection:
     [Create notifications index](https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/careaiproto/firestore/indexes?create_composite=ClFwcm9qZWN0cy9jYXJlYWlwcm90by9kYXRhYmFzZXMvKGRlZmF1bHQpL2NvbGxlY3Rpb25Hcm91cHMvbm90aWZpY2F0aW9ucy9pbmRleGVzL18QARoLCgd1c2VySWQQARoNCgljcmVhdGVkQXQQAhoMCghfX25hbWVfXxAC)

2. For each link, click "Create Index" in the Firebase Console that opens.

3. Wait for the indexes to be created. This may take a few minutes.

### Option 2: Using the Firebase CLI

1. Make sure you have the Firebase CLI installed:
   ```
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Login to Firebase:
   ```
   firebase login
   ```

3. Initialize Firebase in your project (if not already done):
   ```
   firebase init firestore
   ```

4. Add the indexes from the `firebase.indexes.json` file to your `firestore.indexes.json` file.

5. Deploy the indexes:
   ```
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
   ```

## 2. Sound Files

Make sure the sound files are properly placed in the `public/sounds` directory:

- `message-sent.mp3`
- `message-typing.mp3`
- `notification.mp3`

If these files are missing, you can download them from the following sources:

- [message-sent.mp3](https://www.soundjay.com/buttons/sounds/button-3.mp3)
- [message-typing.mp3](https://www.soundjay.com/buttons/sounds/button-24.mp3)
- [notification.mp3](https://www.soundjay.com/buttons/sounds/button-10.mp3)

## 3. CORS Configuration

To fix CORS issues with Firebase Storage:

1. Make sure the `cors.json` file is properly configured with all the required origins
2. Run the following command to update the CORS configuration:

```bash
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://careaiproto.appspot.com
```

## 4. Translations

Make sure the translation files are properly set up in the `public/locales` directory:

- `en/translation.json`
- `fr/translation.json`

These files should contain all the required translations for the social features.

## 5. Hashtag Functionality

The hashtag functionality has been improved to better handle special characters and international characters. The following components have been updated:

- `src/lib/hashtagService.ts`
- `src/components/social/HashtagHighlighter.tsx`

## 6. Subscription Error Handling

The subscription error handling has been improved to prevent unsubscribe errors. The following components have been updated:

- `src/lib/subscriptionService.ts`
- `src/components/SocialInitializer.tsx`

## Testing

After making these changes, test the social features to ensure they are working correctly:

1. Create a post with hashtags
2. Like a post
3. Comment on a post
4. Save a post
5. Share a post
6. Check that notifications are working
7. Check that the trending topics are displayed correctly
8. Check that the hashtags in posts and comments are clickable and navigate to the correct page

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues after making these changes:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Make sure all the required Firebase resources are properly set up
3. Clear your browser cache and reload the page
4. Restart the development server

If problems persist, please provide more details about the specific errors you are encountering.

## Recent Fixes (April 2025)

### 1. Missing Firebase Methods

Added missing methods to the `firebaseSocialService` object:
- `getComments`: Retrieves comments for a post
- `addComment`: Adds a comment to a post

These methods were missing, causing errors when trying to view or add comments to posts.

### 2. French Translation Missing

Added missing French translations for social features:
- Added translations for error messages related to comments and saving posts
- Added translations for success messages

### 3. Post Creation Error

Fixed the issue with undefined imageUrl in post creation:
- Modified `CreatePostModal.tsx` to ensure imageUrl is never undefined
- Changed `imageUrl: imageUrl` to `imageUrl: imageUrl || null`
- This prevents the "Unsupported field value: undefined" error

### 4. Script for Creating Firebase Indexes

Created a script to create the required Firebase index for the notifications collection:
- Created `scripts/create-firebase-indexes.js` to add the required index
- The script can be run with `node scripts/create-firebase-indexes.js`
- It will automatically create and deploy the required indexes
