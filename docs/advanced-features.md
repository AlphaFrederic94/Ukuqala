# Advanced Features in CareAI

This document provides an overview of the advanced features implemented in the CareAI application.

## Digital Twin Health Simulation

The Digital Twin Health Simulation feature creates a personalized digital representation of a user's health status and allows them to simulate the effects of different interventions.

### Key Components

1. **Health Avatar**: A visual representation of the user's current health status, highlighting areas of concern.
2. **Health Metrics**: Displays current health metrics including BMI, blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol.
3. **Lifestyle Simulation**: Allows users to adjust lifestyle factors (exercise, diet, sleep, stress, medication adherence) and see projected health outcomes.
4. **Medication Simulation**: Shows how different medications might affect health metrics and potential interactions.

### Technical Implementation

- Uses Three.js for 3D avatar visualization
- Implements health prediction algorithms based on medical research
- Stores health metrics in the `health_metrics` table
- Tracks changes over time in the `health_history` table

## Blockchain-Secured Health Records

This feature provides secure, immutable storage of health records with granular sharing controls using blockchain technology.

### Key Components

1. **Encrypted Storage**: All health records are encrypted before storage.
2. **Blockchain Verification**: Records are hashed and stored on a blockchain for verification.
3. **Selective Sharing**: Users can grant and revoke access to specific records for healthcare providers.
4. **Access Control**: Comprehensive access management for health records.

### Technical Implementation

- Uses CryptoJS for encryption/decryption
- Implements blockchain verification using Ethereum (simulated in development)
- Stores encrypted records in the `blockchain_health_records` table
- Manages access controls in the `blockchain_health_record_access` table

## Community Health Mapping

This feature creates crowdsourced health maps showing disease outbreaks, healthcare resources, and community health initiatives.

### Key Components

1. **Interactive Map**: Shows healthcare facilities, disease outbreaks, and health events.
2. **Anonymous Reporting**: Allows users to report symptoms and health concerns anonymously.
3. **Facility Information**: Provides details about healthcare facilities including services and wait times.
4. **Outbreak Tracking**: Visualizes disease outbreaks with severity levels and recommended precautions.

### Technical Implementation

- Uses React Leaflet for interactive maps
- Implements geolocation for user positioning
- Stores facility data in the `health_facilities` table
- Tracks outbreaks in the `disease_outbreaks` table
- Manages user reports in the `health_reports` table

## Data Compression and Optimization

This feature implements advanced data compression techniques to optimize storage and bandwidth usage.

### Key Components

1. **Content Compression**: Automatically compresses large text content (social posts, health records).
2. **Image Optimization**: Resizes and compresses images before storage.
3. **Bandwidth Optimization**: Reduces data transfer requirements for mobile users.

### Technical Implementation

- Uses Pako for gzip compression of text content
- Implements automatic compression threshold detection
- Stores compression status in the database
- Transparently handles decompression when retrieving data

## Installation and Setup

To use these advanced features, ensure you have installed the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

The necessary database migrations are included in the `migrations` directory and should be applied to your Supabase database:

```bash
# Run these SQL files in your Supabase SQL editor
migrations/20240620000000_create_digital_twin_tables.sql
migrations/20240620000001_create_health_map_tables.sql
migrations/20240620000002_create_blockchain_health_tables.sql
migrations/20240620000003_add_compression_to_social_posts.sql
```

## Usage

These features are accessible through the following routes in the application:

- `/digital-twin` - Digital Twin Health Simulation
- `/blockchain-health` - Blockchain-Secured Health Records
- `/health-map` - Community Health Mapping

Data compression is automatically applied to social posts and does not require any user interaction.
