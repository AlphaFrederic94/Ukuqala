# CareAI New Features Implementation

This document provides instructions for implementing the new advanced features in CareAI.

## Overview of New Features

1. **Digital Twin Health Simulation**
   - Visual health avatar representing user's health status
   - Interactive lifestyle simulation
   - Medication effects simulation

2. **Blockchain-Secured Health Records**
   - Encrypted health record storage
   - Selective sharing with healthcare providers
   - Blockchain verification

3. **Community Health Mapping**
   - Interactive map of healthcare facilities and outbreaks
   - Anonymous symptom reporting
   - Community health events

4. **Data Compression Optimization**
   - Automatic compression for social media content
   - Improved performance for low-bandwidth environments

## Installation Instructions

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install pako crypto-js ethers leaflet react-leaflet @types/pako @types/crypto-js --legacy-peer-deps
```

2. Add the new pages to your router configuration.

3. The compression service is already implemented in `src/lib/compressionService.ts` and ready to use.

## Database Setup

Instead of using the SQL migration files directly, you'll need to create the necessary tables in your Supabase database. Here's a simplified approach:

### 1. Digital Twin Tables

Create the following tables in your Supabase database:

- `health_metrics`: Stores user health metrics (BMI, blood pressure, etc.)
- `health_history`: Tracks changes in health metrics over time
- `medications`: Stores user medications

### 2. Blockchain Health Tables

Create the following tables:

- `blockchain_health_records`: Stores encrypted health records
- `blockchain_health_record_access`: Manages access permissions
- `blockchain_health_record_verification`: Tracks verification status

### 3. Health Map Tables

Create the following tables:

- `health_facilities`: Stores healthcare facility information
- `disease_outbreaks`: Tracks disease outbreaks
- `health_events`: Stores health events and campaigns
- `health_reports`: Manages anonymous symptom reports

### 4. Social Media Compression

Add an `is_compressed` column to your existing `social_posts` table.

## Usage

1. **Digital Twin**:
   - Access at `/digital-twin`
   - Enter health metrics to see your health avatar
   - Use the simulation tools to see projected outcomes

2. **Blockchain Health Records**:
   - Access at `/blockchain-health`
   - Add health records securely
   - Share records with healthcare providers

3. **Community Health Map**:
   - Access at `/health-map`
   - View healthcare facilities and outbreaks
   - Report symptoms anonymously

4. **Data Compression**:
   - This feature works automatically in the background
   - No user interaction required

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the SQL migrations, you can create the tables manually through the Supabase interface or use the SQL editor with simplified CREATE TABLE statements.

For any other issues, please refer to the component documentation or contact the development team.

## Next Steps

After implementing these features, consider:

1. Adding more health metrics to the Digital Twin
2. Expanding the blockchain verification capabilities
3. Adding more data layers to the Health Map
4. Implementing image compression for social media posts
