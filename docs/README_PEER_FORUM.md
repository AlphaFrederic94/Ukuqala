# Medical Students Hub - Peer Forum

This document provides instructions for setting up and using the Peer Forum feature in the Medical Students Hub application.

## Overview

The Peer Forum is a comprehensive communication platform for medical students, featuring:

- Multiple topic-based servers (Anatomy, Pathology, etc.)
- Text and voice channels
- Rich media sharing (images, files, audio)
- Interactive polls
- Message reactions
- Real-time updates

## Backend Setup

The Peer Forum uses Supabase for its backend. Follow these steps to set up the backend:

### 1. Start Supabase Local Development

```bash
# Start Supabase containers
supabase start

# Verify containers are running
supabase status
```

### 2. Run Migration Scripts

The migration scripts are located in the `supabase/migrations` directory:

```bash
# Apply the database schema
supabase db reset
```

This will run the following migration files:
- `20231101000000_peer_forum.sql` - Creates the database schema
- `20231101000001_peer_forum_seed.sql` - Seeds initial data

### 3. Storage Setup

The migration scripts automatically create the necessary storage buckets:
- `peer_forum_files` - For storing uploaded files, images, and audio messages

### 4. Verify Setup

You can verify the setup by checking the Supabase Studio:

```bash
supabase studio
```

Navigate to:
- **Table Editor** to see the created tables
- **Storage** to see the created buckets
- **Authentication** to manage users

## Frontend Components

The Peer Forum consists of several key components:

1. **PeerForumPage** - Main container component
2. **ServerList** - Left sidebar showing available servers
3. **ChannelList** - Shows channels within the selected server
4. **ChatArea** - Main chat interface with message display and input
5. **MemberList** - Right sidebar showing online members

### Real-time Updates

The forum uses Supabase's real-time features to provide instant updates:
- New messages appear immediately
- Reactions update in real-time
- Poll results update as votes come in

## Database Schema

The Peer Forum uses the following database tables:

- `peer_forum.servers` - Forum servers
- `peer_forum.channels` - Channels within servers
- `peer_forum.messages` - User messages
- `peer_forum.attachments` - Files, images, audio, and polls
- `peer_forum.reactions` - Message reactions
- `peer_forum.polls` - Poll questions
- `peer_forum.poll_options` - Poll options
- `peer_forum.poll_votes` - User votes on polls
- `peer_forum.server_members` - Server membership
- `peer_forum.channel_members` - Channel membership for private channels

## API Service

The `peerForumService.ts` file provides functions for interacting with the backend:

- `getServers()` - Fetch available servers
- `getChannels(serverId)` - Fetch channels for a server
- `getMessages(channelId)` - Fetch messages for a channel
- `createMessage(message)` - Create a new message
- `uploadFile(file, userId)` - Upload a file to storage
- `subscribeToMessages(channelId, callback)` - Subscribe to real-time updates

## Customization

### Adding New Servers

To add a new server, insert a record into the `peer_forum.servers` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO peer_forum.servers (name, description, icon)
VALUES ('New Server', 'Server description', 'üîç');
```

### Adding New Channels

To add a new channel, insert a record into the `peer_forum.channels` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO peer_forum.channels (server_id, name, description, type, category)
VALUES ('server-id', 'channel-name', 'Channel description', 'text', 'CATEGORY NAME');
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Messages not loading**
   - Check if the channel ID is correct
   - Verify that the user has access to the channel

2. **File uploads failing**
   - Check storage bucket permissions
   - Verify file size limits

3. **Real-time updates not working**
   - Check if the publication is enabled for the tables
   - Verify WebSocket connection

```bash
supabase logs
```
